    <p>Hello Everyone! I am excited to get to know you all throughout this semster! I grew up in Southern California, met my husband at BYU-Idaho, and three years ago moved to Provo, UT. Together we have two kids; a three year old and a one year old. I love them so much! I love taking them up the near by canyon and exploring with them. My husband is in his last semester of Flight School (Woohoo!) and we are looking forward to what lies ahead of us after his graduation.

    <p>I am currently a Professional Studies Major earning certificates in Graphic Design, Web and Computer Programming, and Commercial Foundations. I am so thankful for BYU-Idaho and how they make it easy to gain an education no matter your life circumstances. I know that the Lord has a hand in the workings of this university and I am thankful I get to be one of it's students.</p>
